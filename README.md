# sisl-files
Test files and other large files part of the sisl-suite

This repository is mainly intended as a submodule for sisl
to be able to test files in the `pytest` scheme.  
Because I try to keep the sisl repository to a minimum it is necessary
to host such _large_ files in other repositories so they are not part
of the standard distribution.

It is imperative that __all__ Jupyter notebooks are created with Python-3!
