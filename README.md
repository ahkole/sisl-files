# sisl-files
Test files and other large files part of the sisl-suite

This repository is mainly intended as a submodule for sisl
to be able to test files in the `pytest` scheme.  
Because I try to keep the sisl repository to a minimum it is necessary
to host such _large_ files in other repositories so they are not part
of the standard distribution.

It is imperative that __all__ Jupyter notebooks are created with Python-3!

## Limits of file sizes

The GitHub repositories are limited to contain files of 100 MB, so it is imperative
to keep files to a minimum size. This should be considered at all times.

## git lfs

This repository makes use of Git LFS command to make large file storage better.
